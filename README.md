Project Title: Smart Elderly Home Monitoring: An Integrated Analysis of Gas, Temperature, and Position Sensors for Anomaly Detection and Safety Enhancement

Project Overview

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a Smart Elderly Home Monitoring system that integrates gas, temperature, and position sensors to enhance anomaly detection and safety for elderly individuals living independently. The system is designed to detect anomalies such as gas leaks, abnormal temperature changes, and unusual movement patterns using advanced machine learning models.

Research Motivation

With the growing elderly population and the increasing desire for aging in place, there is a pressing need for advanced monitoring systems that can ensure the safety and well-being of seniors. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging sensor data and machine learning techniques to detect anomalies that could indicate potential health or safety risks.

Research Objectives

Model Evaluation: To assess the performance of various machine learning models—Autoencoder, Isolation Forest, Local Outliers Factor (LOF), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM)—in detecting anomalies within a smart home environment.

Sensor Integration: To explore the impact of integrating gas, temperature, and position sensors on the accuracy and reliability of anomaly detection.

System Implementation: To evaluate the practical feasibility of deploying this monitoring system in real-world settings, ensuring scalability and adaptability to different conditions.

Safety Enhancement: To analyze how timely anomaly detection can contribute to preventive measures and improve safety in elderly home environments.

Methodology

The research follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which includes phases such as data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The project uses Python for data analysis and visualization, and various machine learning algorithms are implemented to assess their effectiveness in detecting anomalies.

Data Visualization and Analysis

Data was analyzed and visualized using tools like Tableau and Python libraries.

Key visualizations include histograms, line plots, count plots, and heatmaps that highlight the relationships between sensor readings and detected anomalies.

Results

Autoencoder and Isolation Forest models achieved perfect accuracy scores (1.00), indicating their effectiveness in detecting subtle anomalies.

The LOF model performed well with an accuracy of 0.90, identifying local outliers efficiently.

The One-Class SVM showed limitations with a lower accuracy of 0.03, suggesting challenges in its application for this specific use case.


Conclusion

The research demonstrates the potential of integrated sensor technologies in enhancing the safety of elderly individuals in smart homes. The Autoencoder and Isolation Forest models are particularly effective for this application, providing a robust framework for anomaly detection. Future work could explore the integration of additional sensors and further refinement of the machine learning models to improve detection accuracy.

Future Scope

Expansion of the sensor network to include additional environmental and physiological sensors.

Exploration of real-time data processing techniques to improve the responsiveness of the monitoring system.

Development of a user-friendly interface for caregivers and family members to monitor the well-being of elderly individuals remotely.
